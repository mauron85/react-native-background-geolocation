## Description
React Native fork of [cordova-plugin-background-geolocation](https://github.com/mauron85/cordova-plugin-background-geolocation)
with battery-saving "circular region monitoring" and "stop detection".

This plugin can be used for geolocation when the app is running in the foreground or background.

You can choose from following location providers:
* **DISTANCE_FILTER_PROVIDER**
* **ACTIVITY_PROVIDER**
* **RAW_PROVIDER**

See [Which provider should I use?](/PROVIDERS.md) for more information about providers.

## Breaking changes

### 0.4.x:

* start method doesn't accept callback (use .on("start") event)
* stop method doesn't accept callback (use .on("stop") event)
* for background syncing syncUrl option is required. In version 0.3.x if syncUrl was not set url was used.
* plugin constants are in directly BackgroundGeolocation namespace. (check index.js)
* location property locationId renamed to just id
* iOS pauseLocationUpdates now default to false (because iOS docs now states that you need to restart manually if you set it to true)
* iOS no more requires to call finish method. Instead you can optionally start long running task with startTask

## Compatibility

Due to the rapid changes being made in the React Native ecosystem, this module will support
only the latest version of React Native. Older versions will only be supported if they're
compatible with this module.

| Module           | React Native      |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 0.1.0 - 0.2.0    | 0.33              |
| >=0.3.0          | >=0.47            |

If you are using an older version of React Native with this module some features may be buggy.

If you are using react-native-maps or another lib that requires react-native-maps such as Exponent.js or airbnb's react-native-maps then in addition to the instalation steps described here, you must also change `node_modules/react-native-mauron85-background-geolocation/android/lib/build.gradle` to `gms:play-services-locations` and match the version used by those libraries. (in this case `9.8.0`)

```
dependencies {
    ...
    compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:9.8.0'
    ...
}
```

## Submitting issues

All new issues should follow instructions in [ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).
A properly filled issue report will significantly reduce number of follow up questions and decrease issue resolving time.
Most issues cannot be resolved without debug logs. Please try to isolate debug lines related to your issue.
Instructions for how to prepare debug logs can be found in section [Debugging](#debugging).
If you're reporting an app crash, debug logs might not contain all the necessary information about the cause of the crash.
In that case, also provide relevant parts of output of `adb logcat` command.

## Example Apps

The repository [react-native-background-geolocation-example](https://github.com/mauron85/react-native-background-geolocation-example) hosts an example app for both iOS and Android platform.

    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('location', (location) => {
      // handle your locations here
      // to perform long running operation on iOS
      // you need to create background task
      BackgroundGeolocation.startTask(taskKey => {
        // execute long running task
        // eg. ajax post location
        // IMPORTANT: task has to be ended by endTask
        BackgroundGeolocation.endTask(taskKey);
      });
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('stationary', (stationaryLocation) => {
      // handle stationary locations here
      Actions.sendLocation(stationaryLocation);
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('error', (error) => {

      if (status !== BackgroundGeolocation.AUTHORIZED) {
        // we need to set delay or otherwise alert may not be shown
        setTimeout(() =>
          Alert.alert('App requires location tracking permission', 'Would you like to open app settings?', [
            { text: 'Yes', onPress: () => BackgroundGeolocation.showAppSettings() },
            { text: 'No', onPress: () => console.log('No Pressed'), style: 'cancel' }
          ]), 1000);
      }
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('background', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] App is in background');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.on('foreground', () => {
      console.log('[INFO] App is in foreground');
    });

    BackgroundGeolocation.checkStatus(status => {
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation service is running', status.isRunning);
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation services enabled', status.locationServicesEnabled);
      console.log('[INFO] BackgroundGeolocation auth status: ' + status.authorization);

      // you don't need to check status before start (this is just the example)
      if (!status.isRunning) {
        BackgroundGeolocation.start(); //triggers start on start event
      }
    });

    // you can also just start without checking for status
    // BackgroundGeolocation.start();
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // unregister all event listeners
    BackgroundGeolocation.events.forEach(event => BackgroundGeolocation.removeAllListeners(event));
  }
}

export default BgTracking;

Partial reconfiguration is possible by later providing a subset of the configuration options:

```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  debug: true
});
```

In this case new configuration options will be merged with stored configuration options and changes will be applied immediately.

### start()
Platform: iOS, Android

Start background geolocation.

### stop()
Platform: iOS, Android

Stop background geolocation.

### isLocationEnabled(success, fail)
Deprecated: This method is deprecated and will be removed in next major version.
Use `checkStatus` as replacement.

Platform: iOS, Android

One time check for status of location services. In case of error, fail callback will be executed.

| Success callback parameter | Type      | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`                  | `Boolean` | true/false (true when location services are enabled) |

### checkStatus(success, fail)

Check status of the service

| Success callback parameter | Type      | Description                                          |
|----------------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `isRunning`                | `Boolean` | true/false (true if service is running)              |
| `locationServicesEnabled`  | `Boolean` | true/false (true if location services are enabled)   |
| `authorization`            | `Number`  | authorization status                                 |

Authorization statuses:

* NOT_AUTHORIZED
* AUTHORIZED - authorization to run in background and foreground
* AUTHORIZED_FOREGROUND iOS only authorization to run in foreground only

Note: In the Android concept of authorization, these represent application permissions.

### showAppSettings()
Platform: Android >= 6, iOS >= 8.0

Show app settings to allow change of app location permissions.

### showLocationSettings()
Platform: Android

Show system settings to allow configuration of current location sources.

### getLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return all stored locations.
This method is useful for initial rendering of user location on a map just after application launch.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

```javascript
BackgroundGeolocation.getLocations(
  function (locations) {
    console.log(locations);
  }
);
```

### getValidLocations(success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Method will return locations which have not yet been posted to server.

| Success callback parameter | Type    | Description                    |
|----------------------------|---------|--------------------------------|
| `locations`                | `Array` | collection of stored locations |

### deleteLocation(locationId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS, Android

Delete location with locationId.

### deleteAllLocations(success, fail)
Note: You don't need to delete all locations. The plugin manages the number of stored locations automatically and the total count never exceeds the number as defined by `option.maxLocations`.

Platform: iOS, Android

Delete all stored locations.

Note: Locations are not actually deleted from database to avoid gaps in locationId numbering.
Instead locations are marked as deleted. Locations marked as deleted will not appear in output of `BackgroundGeolocation.getValidLocations`.

### switchMode(modeId, success, fail)
Platform: iOS

Normally the plugin will handle switching between **BACKGROUND** and **FOREGROUND** mode itself.
Calling switchMode you can override plugin behavior and force it to switch into other mode.

In **FOREGROUND** mode the plugin uses iOS local manager to receive locations and behavior is affected
by `option.desiredAccuracy` and `option.distanceFilter`.

In **BACKGROUND** mode plugin uses significant changes and region monitoring to receive locations
and uses `option.stationaryRadius` only.

```
// switch to FOREGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.FOREGROUND_MODE);

// switch to BACKGROUND mode
BackgroundGeolocation.switchMode(BackgroundGeolocation.BACKGROUND_MODE);
```

### getLogEntries(limit, success, fail)
Platform: Android, iOS

Return all logged events. Useful for plugin debugging.
Parameter `limit` limits number of returned entries.
**@see [Debugging](#debugging)** for more information.

### removeAllListeners(event)

Unregister all event listeners for given event

| `longitude`            | `Number`  | Longitude, in degrees.                                                 |
| `accuracy`             | `Number`  | Estimated accuracy of this location, in meters.                        |

Locations parameters `isFromMockProvider` and `mockLocationsEnabled` are not posted to `url` or `syncUrl` by default.
Both can be requested via option `postTemplate`.

Note: Do not use location `id` as unique key in your database as ids will be reused when `option.maxLocations` is reached.

Note: Android currently returns `time` as type of String (instead of Number) [@see issue #9685](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/9685)

| `confidence`       | `Number`  | Percentage indicating the likelihood user is performing this activity. |
| `type`             | `String`  | "IN_VEHICLE", "ON_BICYCLE", "ON_FOOT", "RUNNING", "STILL",             |
|                    |           | "TILTING", "UNKNOWN", "WALKING"                                        |

Event listeners can registered with:

```
const eventSubscription = BackgroundGeolocation.on('event', callbackFn);
```

And unregistered:

```
eventSubscription.remove();
```

Note: Components should unregister all event listeners in `componentWillUnmount` method,
individually, or with `removeAllListeners`

## HTTP locations posting

All locations updates are recorded in the local db at all times. When the App is in foreground or background, in addition to storing location in local db,
the location callback function is triggered. The number of locations stored in db is limited by `option.maxLocations` and never exceeds this number.
Instead, old locations are replaced by new ones.

When `option.url` is defined, each location is also immediately posted to url defined by `option.url`.
If the post is successful, the location is marked as deleted in local db.

When `option.syncUrl` is defined, all locations that fail to post will be coalesced and sent in some time later in a single batch.
Batch sync takes place only when the number of failed-to-post locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`.
Locations are sent only in single batch when the number of locations reaches `option.syncTreshold`. (No individual locations will be sent)

The request body of posted locations is always an array, even when only one location is sent.

Warning: `option.maxLocations` has to be larger than `option.syncThreshold`. It's recommended to be 2x larger. In any other case the location syncing might not work properly.

## Custom post template

With `option.postTemplate` it is possible to specify which location properties should be posted to `option.url` or `option.syncUrl`. This can be useful to reduce the
number of bytes sent "over the "wire".

All wanted location properties have to be prefixed with `@`. For all available properties check [Location event](#location-event).

Two forms are supported:

**jsonObject**

```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  postTemplate: {
    lat: '@latitude',
    lon: '@longitude',
    foo: 'bar' // you can also add your own properties
  }
});
```

**jsonArray**
```
BackgroundGeolocation.configure({
  postTemplate: ['@latitude', '@longitude', 'foo', 'bar']
});
```

Note: only string keys and values are supported.
Note: Keep in mind that all locations (even a single one) will be sent as an array of object(s), when postTemplate is `jsonObject` and array of array(s) for `jsonArray`!

### Android Headless Task (Experimental)

A special task that gets executed when the app is terminated, but the plugin was configured to continue running in the background (option `stopOnTerminate: false`). In this scenario the [Activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html)
was killed by the system and all registered event listeners will not be triggered until the app is relaunched.

**Note:** Prefer configuration options `url` and `syncUrl` over headless task. Use it sparingly!

#### Task event
| Parameter          | Type      | Description                                                            |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event.name`       | `String`  | Name of the event [ "location", "stationary", "activity" ]             |
| `event.params`     | `Object`  | Event parameters. @see [Events](#events)                               |

Keep in mind that the callback function lives in an isolated scope. Variables from a higher scope cannot be referenced!

Following example requires [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) enabled backend server.

```
BackgroundGeolocation.headlessTask(function(event) {
    if (event.name === 'location' ||
      event.name === 'stationary') {
        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.open('POST', 'http://192.168.81.14:3000/headless');
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
        xhr.send(JSON.stringify(event.params));
    }

    return 'Processing event: ' + event.name; // will be logged
});
```

### Example of backend server

[Background-geolocation-server](https://github.com/mauron85/background-geolocation-server) is a backend server written in nodejs with CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing support.
There are instructions how to run it and simulate locations on Android, iOS Simulator and Genymotion.
